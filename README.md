Binary-Clock  by Derek Chapman
============
This is a basic binary clock that is setup to use an Arduino Micro and Real Time Clock (RTC).  When you turn the clock on it will give a short light display.  If all of the lights flash on and off when the clock boots up that indicates a problem with the RTC.
